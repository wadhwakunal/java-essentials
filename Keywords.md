# Java Keywords

Java keywords are also known as reserved words. Keywords are particular words that act as a key to a code. These are predefined words by Java so they cannot be used as a variable or object name or class name.

List of Java Keywords

A list of Java keywords or reserved words are given below:

| Keywords      |Defination|
|---------------|---|
| abstract:     | Java abstract keyword is used to declare an abstract class. An abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.|

| interface     | Java interface keyword is used to declare an interface| It can have only abstract methods|
| long          | Java long keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit integer|
| native        | Java native keyword is used to specify that a method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface)|
| new           | Java new keyword is used to create new objects|
| null          | Java null keyword is used to indicate that a reference does not refer to anything| It removes the garbage value|
| package       | Java package keyword is used to declare a Java package that includes the classes|
| private       | Java private keyword is an access modifier| It is used to indicate that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class in which it is declared|
| protected     | Java protected keyword is an access modifier| It can be accessible within the package and outside the package but through inheritance only| It can't be applied with the class|
| public        | Java public keyword is an access modifier| It is used to indicate that an item is accessible anywhere| It has the widest scope among all other modifiers|
| return        | Java return keyword is used to return from a method when its execution is complete|
| short         | Java short keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 16-bit integer|
| <b>static</b> | Java static keyword is used to indicate that a variable or method is a class method| The static keyword in Java is mainly used for memory management|
| <b>super</b>  | Java super keyword is a reference variable that is used to refer to parent class objects| It can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method|
| switch        | The Java switch keyword contains a switch statement that executes code based on test value| The switch statement tests the equality of a variable against multiple values|
| synchronized  | Java synchronized keyword is used to specify the critical sections or methods in multithreaded code|
| <b>this</b>   | Java this keyword can be used to refer the current object in a method or constructor|
| throw         | The Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception| The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions| It is followed by an instance|
| throws        | The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception| Checked exceptions can be propagated with throws|
| transient     | Java transient keyword is used in serialization| If you define any data member as transient, it will not be serialized|
| try           | Java try keyword is used to start a block of code that will be tested for exceptions| The try block must be followed by either catch or finally block|
| void          | Java void keyword is used to specify that a method does not have a return value|
| volatile      | Java volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable may change asynchronously|
| while         | Java while keyword is used to start a while loop| This loop iterates a part of the program several times| If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop|

### Static keyword used -
+ with a variable : A static keyword used with a variable means that the variable in that class is not object specific but it is now class specific
+ with a method/function : The function can only access static variables.
  Cannot use the this keyword inside that function.
+ static block : Static blocks are a special type of blocks that we can use inside a class.The advantage of using static block is that if we keep static components inside the block then they are loaded only once.

### Super 
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
+ super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
+ super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
+ super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

<b>Note</b>: super() is added in each class constructor automatically by compiler if there is no super() or this().


### Final
The Final keyword can be used with:
+ variables
+ methods
+ and classes.

<b>Final variables</b>
A variable marked final means that, once initialized, it can never change its value.
If you don’t give a value to a blank final variable in the constructor (and only in the constructor, there’s no other way to assign a value to a blank final variable) the compiler will catch it and will raise an error.
A static final variable that is not initialized during declaration can only be initialized in a static initializer (a static initializer is a block of code that runs when a class is loaded before any other code can use the class:)Static final variables are constants.

<b> Final methods</b>
Final methods cannot be overridden. A subclass can inherit a method from a parent class even if the method of the parent class is a final method but it cannot change its implementation:
There’s no need to mark a method final if the class itself is final. If a class is final it can never be subclassed, so none of the methods can ever be overridden.

<b>Final classes</b>
Final classes cannot be extended, i.e. you can’t make a subclass that inherits from its parent if this is marked final.
